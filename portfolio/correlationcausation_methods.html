			<div class="container case-main">
				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Overview of the Problem:</b> Psychology students - and the general public - can typically parrot the phrase, "correlation doesn't imply causation". Even still, people tend to make causal claims about correlational findings. And, having taught an undergraduate research methods in psychology course for multiple years, I learned that students struggle to develop a deeper understanding of this concept.
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Solution:</b> We developed an intervention that uses causal diagrams to teach undergraduate students why they should make stronger causal claims based on the findings from an experiment versus an observational study. We also tested three different methods of instruction for the intervention, to find which methods work best for Intro Psych students and Research Methods students.

				<div class="container case-main">
					We taught every participant how to use causal diagrams to illustrate alternative explanations for a correlation. Our goal was for participants to learn that <b>there are more explanations for a correlation in an observational study than in an experiment</b>. If they could learn this, they may be less likely to make erroneous causal claims about observational studies.

								For example, consider a study that finds a positive correlation between meditation and life satisfaction.

							On the other hand, there are two alternative possibilities:
							<ul>
								<li>Maybe, it's a case of <b>reverse causality</b>, and people who have higher life satisfaction are more likely to seek out self-care activities like meditating.</li>
								<li>Maybe, it's a case of a <b>confound/common cause</b>, and the two variables aren't causally related; instead, a third variable causes both. For example, people who are stressed at work may have less time to meditate and also have lower life satisfaction. It would look like life satisfaction and meditation are correlated, but it's really that work stress causes both variables.</li>

					<b>Why does this matter?</b> In an experiment, we can rule out  alternative possibilities for a correlation because of random assignment to conditions. Therefore, we can be more confident in making causal claims about experiments. We should be very hesitant to (read: almost never!) make causal claims about observational studies.

					<div class="left-col case-main">


						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							After learning about causal diagrams, participants completed <b>two practice problems that applied the concepts from the tutorial</b>. The goal was for participants to think about whether each causal diagram was possible in a hypothetical observational study or experiment. 
						</p>

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							Participants were assigned to one of three interventions; <b>the format of the two practice problems differed across the interventions</b>. We modeled the interventions based on prior research that shows different instructional methods can promote different features of knowledge.

					<div class="right-col">
						<center><b>The Three Interventions:</b></center>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Worked Example</b>: Participants were given the practice problem and the solution simultaneously. Prior research suggests it can help with learning about procedural steps in problem-solving, but not necessarily with reducing errors in understanding.</li>
							<li><b>Analogical Comparison</b>: Participants made comparisons between the practice problem and a previous example in the tutorial. Prior research suggests it can help make connections between conceptual knowledge and procedural steps, but not necessarily reduce errors in misunderstanding.</li>
							<li><b>Self Explanation</b>: Participants self-generated their own causal diagrams and reasoning for whether alternative explanations were possible. Prior research suggests it can help with applying concepts to abstract principles, but not necessarily learning procedural steps.</li>

					<ul>

							The next step would be to conduct A/B testing to test whether adding user reviews actually <b>improves customer trust and conversion</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							A key takeaway was that customers from a wide age range purchase internet or change internet service providers (ISPs) and their needs differ. I noticed a trend where <b>older participants did not care about the reviews</b> and said that the reviews actually reduced their trust in the ISP; <b>whereas the younger participants sought out this information</b> when making their purchase. If this trend is reliable, future solutions would need to balance the needs of both users.
