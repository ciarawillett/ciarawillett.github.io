		<div class="case-div">
			<div class="container case-main">
				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Overview of the Problem:</b> Psychology students - and the general public - can typically parrot the phrase, "correlation doesn't imply causation". Even still, people tend to make causal claims about correlational findings. And, having taught an undergraduate research methods in psychology course for multiple years, I learned that students struggle to develop a deeper understanding of this concept.
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Solution:</b> We developed an intervention that uses causal diagrams to teach undergraduate students why they should make stronger causal claims based on the findings from an experiment versus an observational study. We also tested three different methods of instruction for the intervention, to find which methods work best for Intro Psych students and Research Methods students. 
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Participants:</b> We recruited 263 Intro Psych students and 336 Research Methods students at the University of Pittsburgh. Students in the Research Methods course were farther along in the psychology program, and therefore had more background knowledge. The entire study, including the intervention & measures, was completed on Qualtrics.

				<div class="subtitle">Using Causal Diagrams to Improve Understanding</div>

				<div class="container case-main">
					We taught every participant how to use causal diagrams to illustrate alternative explanations for a correlation. Our goal was for participants to learn that <b>there are more explanations for a correlation in an observational study than in an experiment</b>. If they could learn this, they may be less likely to make erroneous causal claims about observational studies.

							On the other hand, there are two alternative possibilities:

								<li>Maybe, it's a case of a <b>confound/common cause</b>, and the two variables aren't causally related; instead, a third variable causes both. For example, people who are stressed at work may have less time to meditate and also have lower life satisfaction. It would look like life satisfaction and meditation are correlated, but it's really that work stress causes both variables.</li>

							<li><b>Analogical Comparison</b>: Participants made comparisons between the practice problem and a previous example in the tutorial. Prior research suggests it can help make connections between conceptual knowledge and procedural steps, but not necessarily reduce errors in misunderstanding.</li>
							<li><b>Self Explanation</b>: Participants self-generated their own causal diagrams and reasoning for whether alternative explanations were possible. Prior research suggests it can help with applying concepts to abstract principles, but not necessarily learning procedural steps.</li>

				<div class="subtitle">Future Directions / Takeaways</div>

				<div class="container case-main">

					<ul>
						<li>
							In the next study, we thought about <b>how to improve the tutorial to increase correlation-causation discrimination at posttest</b>. First, it looks like participants need more instruction about how to tell if a design is an observational study or an experiment. Second, we changed the wording or presentation of items or content in the tutorial to emphasize the important aspects of the tutorial. 
						</li>
						<li>
							We also wondered whether this type of intervention could <b>improve performance on related tasks</b>, like knowing how to design an observational study versus an experiment. In a follow-up study, we tested whether participants designed the correct type of study when prompted. 
						</li>
						<li>
							More generally, I <b>learned a lot about mentoring & qualitative coding</b>. In the beginning, my team could spend upwards of 15 minutes trying to resolve a disagreement about how to categorize a single response. I learned how to guide the research assistants back on track, to focus on the bigger picture and not get too bogged down in the details. At the same time, this was a learning experience for the students and they needed practice with considering alternative perspectives. Sometimes, there wasn't a perfect answer for how to code a participant's response. I learned when to let the research assistants discuss in more detail versus step in and choose the best option so that we could keep moving. 
						</li>
