		<!-- OVERVIEW OF PROJECT -->

		<div class="case-div">
			<div class="container case-main">
				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Overview of the Problem:</b> Although first-year law students begin their studies full of enthusiasm, many are full of anxiety by the end of the first-semester. They have anxieties about grades & performance in the classroom, future job prospects, the competitive atmosphere. Many experience imposter syndrome and feel that they do not belong; others experience a similar feeling called "pluralistic ignorance" - the idea that no one else around them was struggling. Often, students adopt a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618804166">"fixed mindset"</a> - that one has a fixed amount of intelligence, and that they are unable to grow or change. 
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Solution:</b> The <a href="https://www.law.pitt.edu/centers/fostering-resilience-and-engagement-law-students">Fostering Resilience and Engagement</a> project is a collaborative effort by law professors and psychologists to address the social and academic needs of students; to help students become more resilient and the process of legal education more humane. Our team is testing a series of well-timed interventions during the students' first year of law school. These interventions encourage the student to adopt an "adaptive mindset", with the goal of promoting resilience & growth.

						<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px">
							The goal of the Belongingness Intervention is to encourage law students to <b>adopt an "adaptive mindset"</b> - that they can grow their abilities and that everyone has the chance to succeed. We implemented two versions (in-person and online) of the intervention to test if different methods wree more effective. The in-person intervention was completed during students' first-year writing seminar, and was held in a focus-group style format over Zoom during the pandemic.

							<ul>
								<li>Discussion facilitator frames students as the <b>foremost experts of the law student experience & their input is valued and will be used to help future students</b>. This was established at the very beginning - it is both true and also a strategy to encourage sharing through "helping others".</li>
								<li>Short ice breaker to create an environment where students feel comfortable sharing.</li>
								<li>Write down 3 bad experiences and 3 good experiences from their first year.</li>
								<li>Encourage students to share more about their experiences.</li>
								<li>At key time points in the intervention, the facilitator explained the concept of "pluralistic ignorance" and encouraged students to reframe their perspectives. For example, is there a <i>right</i> profile for a law student?</li>

				<div class="subtitle">Data Analysis</div>

				<div class="cards" style="padding-bottom:30px !important">
					<div class="left-col case-main">

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							At the end of the survey, 144 participants responded to an open-ended question in which they could reflect on their experience with the grading curve at Pitt Law. 
						</p>

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							I categorized participants' responses into several main themes that best represented students' experiences, and compiled a comprehensive report to summarize the data. In general, <b>most (74%) students were not in favor of the curve</b>.
						</p>

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							When drafting a report for the administration, the primary goal was to ensure that students' experiences were communicated. In addition to providing aggregate data about the main themes in participants' responses, I also included individual quotes - because students would not be at the meeting, I wanted to highlight their voices in the document. If there were different opinions about an issue, I sampled a proportionate number of quotations from each side.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="right-col what-we-learned">
						<b>What We Learned</b><br><br>
						
						The students overwhelmingly expressed negative feelings and experiences about the grading curve. A few key themes emerged:

						<ol>
							<li>Grades are <b>not merit-based</b> and do not reflect the individual's knowledge or actual abilities. (57% of respondents).</li>
							<li>The curve <b>affects students' motivation</b> (49% of respondents); roughly two-thirds of these participants said that it had a negative effect, and some said that it had a somewhat positive effect because it encouraged competition.</li>
							<li>The curve had a <b>negative impact on mental health</b> and caused a significant amount of stress for 41% of respondents.</li>
							<li>Students (22%) said that the curve negatively affects their <b>interpersonal relationships</b> or creates an environment that is <b>too competitive</b>.</li>
							<li>Several students (14%) said that when given the choice, they <b>do not select classes that use a curve</b>.</li>
						</ol>

			<div class="container">

				<div class="subtitle">What Happened Next & Placing our Findings into Context</div>

				<div class="container case-main">

					<ul>
						<li>
							After reading and discussing the findings in our report, <b>the faculty & administration voted to remove the grading curve policy</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <a href="https://www.law.pitt.edu/centers/fostering-resilience-and-engagement-law-students">Fostering Resilience and Engagement</a> project has been working on a series of interventions that encourage students to adopt an adaptive mindset - that their intelligence can grow and they can overcome challenges during law school. However, <b>it is difficult to encourage an adaptive mindset at the individual level when institutional policies - like a grading curve - communicate a fixed mindset.</b> Our hope is that the adoption of an adaptive mindset at multiple levels of the school - the student, the faculty, the institution level - will help students thrive.
