		<!-- OVERVIEW OF PROJECT -->

		<div class="case-div">
			<div class="container case-main">

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					The <a href="https://www.law.pitt.edu/centers/fostering-resilience-and-engagement-law-students">Fostering Resilience and Engagement</a> project is a collaborative effort by law professors and psychologists to address the social and academic needs of students; to help students become more resilient and the process of legal education more humane. 
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Problem 1:</b> Although first-year law students begin their studies full of enthusiasm, many are full of anxiety by the end of the first-semester. They have anxieties about grades & performance in the classroom, future job prospects, the competitive atmosphere. Many experience imposter syndrome and feel that they do not belong; others experience a similar feeling called "pluralistic ignorance" - the idea that no one else around them was struggling. Often, students adopt a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618804166">"fixed mindset"</a> - that one has a fixed amount of intelligence, and that they are unable to grow or change. 
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Problem 2:</b> Data collection on this project has been ongoing for three years, but there is an outstanding need for an organized system to improve data collection & collaboration efforts.

								Over the past three years, our team has tested a series of well-timed interventions during the students' first year of law school. These interventions encourage the student to adopt an "adaptive mindset" -  that they can grow their abilities and that everyone has the chance to succeed - with the goal of promoting resilience & growth.
							</p>
							<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
								We implemented two versions (in-person and online) of the intervention to test if different methods were more effective. The in-person intervention was completed during students' first-year writing seminar, and was held in a focus-group style format over Zoom during the pandemic.
							</p>

							<p style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px">
								<span style="color:#E46868;font-weight:bold;padding-right:8px">My role</span> I joined the team in the third year of data collection - during that year, I was a co-facilitator and lead facilitator for some of the in-person (Zoom) focus groups.

								To test the effectiveness of the interventions, students were given surveys at the beginning of their first year, at the beginning of their second semester (during the intervention), and at the end of their second semester. There have been several iterations of the intervention & surveys to measure success over the past three years. 
							</p>
							<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
								My primary role on this project has been to <b>create a more organized system for data collection and analysis</b>. Because my involvement is time-limited, I had to identify weaknesses in our current methods & implement solutions that would be easily accessible and understood by any future researchers. A larger goal of the project is to collaborate with other universities and graduate programs - to do this well, we needed more organization and structure in our methods.

						<span style="color:#E46868;font-weight:bold;padding-right:8px">Reference Manual for Survey Measures</span> Many of the measures we used to evaluate the success of the interventions were changed over the three years. Because success was difficult to measure quantitatively; it made sense to revise the measures as we learned more & based on the needs of the students at the time (e.g., including questions about the pandemic). 
					</p>

					<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
						As we became more confident in what questions to ask students, we started repeating the same measures at multiple timepoints. It was important to make sure that key measures would be tracked the same way - in wording and using the same scales - over time. I created a document that listed all the measures that we have previously used, and whether participants were only asked these questions once (i.e., before the intervention) or at multiple time points (i.e., before, during, and after the intervention). This created an easy reference that could be used to maintain consistency across studies, figure out the correct statistical test for analysis, brainstorm new survey questions, or share our insights with other organizations.

						<span style="color:#E46868;font-weight:bold;padding-right:8px">Data Dictionary</span> A major potential pain point is the ability to understand the naming conventions of particular variables in our dataset - either years down the line, or without the original survey creator available. Many of the questions were worded very similarly to each other, and therefore had very similar variable names or acronyms. I created an organized data dictionary that others could quickly reference during analysis.

				<div class="container case-main">

					<ul>
						<li>
							I am currently analyzing the data for this project - we will be publishing some of our results soon!
						</li>
						<li>
							Throughout this experience, I have learned so much from students and their willingness to share their experiences about the transition to law school. Often, academic interventions take a top-down approach and are implemented without first consulting the people they affect most. <b>We placed the students' voices at the center of our work</b>, and used them to inform our efforts moving forward. For example, our conversations revealed a <b>potential pain point in our efforts to improve resilience and engagement - the grading curve</b>. The grading curve is an institutional policy that invokes a "fixed mindset" - only a certain number of "top" students can earn "A's" and grades are valued more than growth. Recently, we worked with students and faculty to overturn this policy - our hope is that this institutional change will improve our efforts to encourage an adaptive mindset at the individual level.
