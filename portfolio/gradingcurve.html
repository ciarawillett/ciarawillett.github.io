			<div class="container case-main">

					<b>Overview of the Problem:</b> This project was one goal of the <a href="https://www.law.pitt.edu/centers/fostering-resilience-and-engagement-law-students">Fostering Resilience and Engagement</a> project at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, in which a group of faculty and researchers is working to address the social and academic needs of students. During one-on-one conversations with students, many brought up their frustrations and negative experiences with the grading curve at the University; only a certain number of students are allowed to receive an A in certain courses. 
				</p>

				<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
					<b>Solution:</b> Before the administration and faculty discussed the future of the grading curve policy at an upcoming meeting, we surveyed students about their perceptions of the curve & drafted a report. Based on our findings & discussions with faculty, the administration voted to remove the grading curve in future semesters.

				<div class="case-main">
					<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
						I was brought on as a consultant during the survey generation process. Because students are inundated with surveys, we wanted to keep the quantitative measures to a minimum, and ask only one short-answer response question. My edits to the survey questions focused primarily on addressing the following concerns:
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="left-col case-main">

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							<ul>
								<li>Are the response choices clear, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive?</li>
								<li>Is the question double-barrelled or unclear as to how participants should be responding? For example, instead of, How has the grading curve affected you? - ask two separate questions about 1) whether the curve has affected their academic performance, 2) whether the curve has affected their mental health.</li>
								<li>How can we reduce the amount of reading that students have to do to complete the survey, without comprimising its integrity?</li>
								<li>Are we using the appropriate response scales? Would a continuous scale be more appropriate than a binary response?</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="left-col case-main">

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							At the end of the survey, 144 participants responded to an open-ended question in which they could reflect on their experience with the grading curve at Pitt Law. 
						</p>

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							I categorized participants' responses into several main themes that best represented students' experiences, and compiled a comprehensive report to summarize the data. In general, <b>most (74%) students were not in favor of the curve</b>.
						</p>

						<p style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px">
							When drafting a report for the administration, the primary goal was to ensure that students' experiences were communicated. In addition to providing aggregate data about the main themes in participants' responses, I also included individual quotes - because students would not be at the meeting, I wanted to highlight their voices in the document. If there were different opinions about an issue, I sampled a proportionate number of quotations from each side.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="right-col">
						<b>What We Learned:</b><br><br>
						
						The students overwhelmingly expressed negative feelings and experiences about the grading curve. A few key themes emerged:

						<ol>
							<li>Grades are <b>not merit-based</b> and do not reflect the individual's knowledge or actual abilities. (57% of respondents).</li>
							<li>The curve <b>affects students' motivation</b> (49% of respondents); roughly two-thirds of these participants said that it had a negative effect, and some said that it had a somewhat positive effect because it encouraged competition.</li>
							<li>The curve had a <b>negative impact on mental health</b> and caused a significant amount of stress for 41% of respondents.</li>
							<li>Students (22%) said that the curve negatively affects their <b>interpersonal relationships</b> or creates an environment that is <b>too competitive</b>.</li>
							<li>Several students (14%) said that when given the choice, they <b>do not select classes that use a curve</b>.</li>
						</ol>

				<div class="subtitle">What Happened Next & Placing our Findings into Context</div>

				<div class="container case-main">

					<ul>
						<li>
							After reading and discussing the findings in our report, <b>the faculty & administration voted to remove the grading curve policy</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <a href="https://www.law.pitt.edu/centers/fostering-resilience-and-engagement-law-students">Fostering Resilience and Engagement</a> project has been working on a series of interventions that encourage students to adopt an adaptive mindset - that their intelligence can grow and they can overcome challenges during law school. However, <b>it is difficult to encourage an adaptive mindset at the individual level when institutional policies like a grading curve communicate a fixed mindset.</b> Our hope is that the adoption of an adaptive mindset at multiple levels of the school - the student, the faculty, the institution level - will help students thrive.
